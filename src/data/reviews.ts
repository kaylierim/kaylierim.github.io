      "<p><i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</i> is a tale of two best friends who make video games together. However, it feels much deeper than just a story. It taps into themes of friendship, life meaning, loss, disability, and the human condition.</p><p>I already knew from the start of this book that it would be special. There are times when you are reading a book and you feel disconnected, disengaged, or even uninterested. However, this book made me feel seen, warm, and loved? It was strangely cathartic.</p><p>I will say that I felt weirdly connected with this book because of how much it drew similarity to my life. This book takes place in many locations such as California, Massachusetts, and New York. All states I have spent a significant amount of time in. Sam, the main character, is Korean-American, as am I. So, maybe I was made to enjoy this book.</p><p>Just to give you a taste of her writing, here is a quote I found amusing.</p><p>'SADIE MIRANDA GREEN, YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!' Sam could be ignored, but the childish shared reference could not be. It was an invitation to play. She turned.</p><p>Throughout my time reading this book, I couldn't be without a highlighter. The writing was amazing. If you enjoyed the prose in books like <i>Alone with You in the Ether</i> by Olivie Blake or <i>Normal People</i> by Sally Rooney, this book might be your new favorite. This book also made me tear up multiple times which automatically makes me favor it.</p><p>Yes, a hundred times yes I recommend this book.</p>",

      "<p>Seelig's book dives deep into the field of business and innovation, explaining how simple changes in thinking can make a big difference. As a computer science major, I don't get much exposure to the \"entrepreneurial mindset\" so I learned plenty in such a short book. Big thank you to one of my father’s good friends for giving it to me!</p><p>My main takeaways from this book include:</p><ul><li>You do not need to ask for permission to be great</li><li>You can make do with what you already have</li><li>You must put yourself in a position to <em>be</em> lucky</li><li>You should go into a field where what you love and what you are talented at agree</li></ul><h3>You do not need to ask for permission to be great</h3><blockquote><p>\"Over time, I've became increasingly aware that the world is divided into people who wait for others to give them permission to do the things they want to do and people who grant themselves permission.\" (Seelig)</p></blockquote><p>Throughout the book, Seelig recounts success stories of those who did not let their imposter syndrome get the best of them. They reached their full potential by &quot;not asking for permission&quot;. They didn&#39;t have to ask for permission to start their own business or publish their own book or seize an opportunity. They did it because they believed they could, and sometimes that is half the battle.</p><p>Seelig tells her students to &quot;never miss an opportunity to be fabulous&quot;. She explains that being fabulous means &quot;making the decision to go beyond what&#39;s expected at all times&quot; (Seelig).</p><p>These lessons are crucial to learn early on because students often have to follow specific guidelines to do well. Contrary to college or high school life, there are no strict rubrics that dictate whether one &quot;got 100 or failed&quot;. Therefore, those who go above and beyond are the ones who think outside of the box and are more likely to succeed.</p><h3>You can make do with what you already have</h3><p>Many times in this book, Seelig talks about the assignments she gives her students at Stanford. Most of these assignments include developing innovative ideas, utilizing what they already have. For example, they might use rubberbands or paper clips to create a make-believe brand.</p><p>To an extent, this concept ties into the last bullet point because it shows that you don&#39;t need to be someone with abundant resources or a genius brain to be as successful as Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. One could simply see an opportunity and seize it with what they have.</p><h3>You must put yourself in a position to <em>be</em> lucky/Goldberg Story</h3><p>Seelig tells us a story of a man, Goldberg, who wished to win the lottery. Summed up, he prayed to God every day but to no avail. One day, he got fed up and said that God let him down. God responded by saying that the least Goldberg do is buy a ticket.</p><p>This story stuck with me the most. Sometimes, I find myself thinking similarly to Goldberg. For example, if I wish to have more friends, how am I actively achieving this? If I sit at home every day, not leaving my house, I am almost expecting a miracle to happen. However, if I join clubs and socialize with strangers, I have a much better chance of achieving my goal.</p><h3>You should go into a field where what you love and what you are talented at agree/Lao-Tzu's quote</h3><blockquote><p>&quot;The master of the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his reaction, his love and his religion. He simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him, he is always doing both.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This quote reminds me of my father, someone I am inspired by. He went into a field which Seelig calls “the sweet spot”, an industry where one can thrive. I hope that in whichever field go into, I am driven by passion and curiosity, not monetary value (maybe a little though ;) ).</p>",
