  aboutMe:
    "I'm a Computer Science student at Northeastern University specializing in front-end development. At AWS, I delivered a complete redesign of the ECS Task Definition Details page end-to-end—implementing comprehensive Jest testing, participating in code reviews, and completing stretch goals including persistent browser state. At Globaleur, I built reusable UI components with TypeScript and React, redesigned key pages like the homepage and navigation, and resolved 50+ tickets in an Agile workflow. I'm also a Teaching Assistant for Professional Development for Co-op, where I help students prepare for their own career journeys through mock interviews and resume reviews.",
